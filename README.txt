Project description

The Universal Tibetan Font Converter was created by Tashi Tsering with funding from the Trace Foundation. The objective of the development is to provide the community a tool for converting files between different Tibetan encoding schemes with different file formats. The converter also can translate Tibetan script with different encodings to variant Wylie transliterations, and vice versa.

The converter covers 17 different Tibetan encoding schemes including 4 Tibetan transliteration schemes (ACIP, ALA-LC, THL Wylie, Wylie), Tibetan Unicode, and other 12 legacy Tibetan fonts including:

Sambhota 1.0 (Sama)
Sambhota 2.0 (Dedris)
Bandrida
Tongyuan
Beida Founder
Huanguang
LTibetan
Jamyang
TCRC Bod-Yig
Tibetan Machine
Tibetan Machine Web
National Standard Extended

The converter also covers four common file formats including txt, Unicode txt, rich text file format (RTF) and HTML web page. You can convert file between arbitrary two encoding schemes from 16 ones mentioned above with certain file formats.

The converter has some bugs and additional information on the file format supported can be found at http://www.trace.org/utfc. Any improvement of the application would be very much appreciated.
